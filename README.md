EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYTICS AND DATA PRE-PROCESSING TASK.
PART 1
The dataset cancer.csv was used for this task. This dataset contains variables that have bearing in predicting whether a brain tumour is likely to be malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous). 


PART 2
You currently own a house in Francistown, Botswana and want to put your house on the market. Youâ€™re not in a hurry to get rid of the house and would like to try selling it yourself. One way to determine a reasonable asking price of a house is to call one or more real estate agents and seek their advice. Another is to hire an appraiser; this approach would cost several thousands of Pula. You have been wondering if there might be an easier and cheaper way to understand what determines the selling prices in the area.
Your data analyst friend has determined that the variable that has the highest predictive power for the price of a house is its floor area in square meters. She has collected data of house prices alongside floor areas and saved it in a file called prices.csv.
Write Python code snippets that perform data analysis.
